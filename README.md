# Stock-Data-Analysis_with_Risk-and-Value-Prediction
The stock market has always been a fascinating topic for me. And recently I wanted to learn more about them. So I tried to write a program where I could analyze all the data of any stock I want (data is taken from yahoo finance and alpha vantage) and know about its variance, trade increment, decrement, and etc. <br/>
Apart from analyzing and leaning about stock's historical data, I have tried to know about the risk involved in buying a particular stock.<br/>
As we know, most of the stocks are co-dependent on each other either directly or inversely, so I have added a heat map for the already listed 32 stocks(mix of all the major genres) which tells us about their correlativity and codependence with numbers and colors. <br/>
At last, I have tried to predict the closing price of stocks in the future (30 days here) with regression and deep learning models. I have successfully created a model that predicts the future stock price with 97.4% accuracy. <br/>
Apart from all the above-listed functions, I have also added various other small features that will help the user in analyzing the data with increased accuracy.
